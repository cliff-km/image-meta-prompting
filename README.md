# image-meta-prompting
A set of tools for managing and generating image prompts. Developed mostly for Midjourney.

For now you can just paste oone of the rulesets in to ChatGPT and giving a prompt direction. 

For example:
```
[Entire Ruleset Body]


Using the rules, create 5 prompts for fantasy vending machines that sell magical potions.
```

I've noticed that you tend to get more diverse output by asking for multiple prompts. I will attempt to address this with future updates and tools.

You can also add rules to adjust the rules to your personal preferences. For example I add the rules:
```
11. Use words to lean the prompt to create weird and striking art. For example: otherworldly, dreamy, bizarre, ethereal
12. Use words to give the prompt occult tones. For example: ceremonial, occult, transubstantiation, consecrated
```

The list of artists is a temporary solution to getting GPT to select random artists that Midjourney recognizes.
