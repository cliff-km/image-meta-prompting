# image-meta-prompting
A set of tools for managing and generating image prompts. Developed mostly for Midjourney.

For now you can just paste oone of the rulesets in to ChatGPT and giving a prompt direction. 

For example:
```
[Entire Ruleset Body]


Using the rules, create 5 prompts for an fantasy vending machine that sells magical potions.
```

I've noticed that you tend to get more diverse output by asking for multiple prompts. I will attempt to address this with future updates and tools.
